This project explores a dataset of U.S. medical insurance costs to uncover basic insights using Python. The dataset includes demographic and personal health information such as age, BMI, smoking status, and number of children.

## ü•Ö Project Goals
- Understand trends in medical insurance charges
- Explore potential correlations (e.g. smoking and cost)
- Practice data cleaning, transformation, and analysis

## üìä Dataset
- Source: Codecademy‚Äôs "U.S. Medical Insurance" CSV file
- Columns include: `age`, `sex`, `bmi`, `children`, `smoker`, `region`, `charges`

## üîç Analysis Questions
- What is the average age of the patients?
- What regions are most represented?
- How do charges compare between smokers and non-smokers?
- What is the average age of individuals with at least one child?

## üõ† Tools Used
- Python 3
- CSV module
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub

## üöß Status
Project in progress. Next step: exploring analysis functions and saving column data as variables.
